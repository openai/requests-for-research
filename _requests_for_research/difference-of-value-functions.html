<p>Bertsekas wrote <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.67.2646&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">an interesting paper</a> arguing why it might be better to learn functions that measure the difference in value between states, rather than the value of states. Implement this algorithm with neural networks and apply it to challenging Gym environments.</p>
