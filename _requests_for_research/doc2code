title: 'Doc2Code'
summary: "Given a docstring, generate the source code of a program that satisfies program description in the docstring. Or alternatively, given source code, generate docstrings that describe the function of the source code. If you're feeling extra ambitious, acquire/generate test cases for each triplet and then generate the source code of programs that satisfy test cases as well."

<p> The (extremely) ambitious goal of this request is to solve the problem
  of generating code from docstrings, or to alternatively solve the problem of generating docstrings from code.  
  It is outside the reach of current machine learning algorithms.
  However, <a href="https://github.com/Avmb">Antonio Valerio Miceli Barone</a>
  has collected <a href="https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/code-docstring-corpus">150,370 triples of function declarations,
  docstrings and bodies</a>.  Refer to the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02275 for a baseline and an explanation behind
  the motivation of the dataset. If you're feeling extra ambitious, first figure out a way to acquire/generate test cases 
  for each of the triplets, and then use those test cases to verify that the generated code is functionally correct. </p>
