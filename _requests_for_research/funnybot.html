<p>Train a character-level language model on a corpus of jokes.</p>


<p>To do so, you can use the following datasets:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/taivop/joke-dataset">200k English jokes dataset</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavmoudgil95/short-jokes">Short Jokes dataset</a></li>
</ul>

<p> or build your own (the larger the better; if you do so, please submit a pull request and we'll link to your dataset), implement a character-level LSTM (or use an existing implementation), train it on this dataset, and draw samples from it.  If successful, the output from the LSTM should be actually funny.</p>
