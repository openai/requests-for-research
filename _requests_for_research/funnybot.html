<p>Train a character-level language model on a corpus of jokes.</p>


<p>To do so, use <a href="https://github.com/taivop/joke-dataset">this 200k English jokes dataset</a> or build your own (the larger the better; if you do so, please submit a pull request and we'll link to your dataset), implement a character-level LSTM (or use an existing implementation), train it on this dataset, and draw samples from it.  If successful, the output from the LSTM should be actually funny.
