title: Multiobjective RL
summary: ''
difficulty: 2 # out of 3

<p>In reinforcement learning, we often have several rewards that we
care about. For example, in robotic locomotion, we want to maximize
forward velocity but minimize joint torque and impact with the
  ground. </p>

<p> The standard practice is to use a reward function that is a
weighted sum of these terms. However, it is often difficult to balance
the factors to achieve satisfactory performance on all rewards.
</p>

<p><i>Filter methods</i> are algorithms from multi-objective
optimization that seek to generate a sequence of points, so that each
one is not strictly dominated by a previous one (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150501032342if_/http://home.agh.edu.pl:80/~pba/pdfdoc/Numerical_Optimization.pdf#page=454">Nocedal &amp;
    Wright</a>, chapter 15.4). </p>

<p> Develop a filter method for RL that jointly optimizes a collection
of reward functions, and test it on the
Gym <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs#mujoco">MuJoCo
environments</a>. Most of these have summed rewards; you would need to
inspect the code of the environments to find the individual
components.</p>

There exists some prior work on multiobjective optimization in an RL context.  See the following <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.0590.pdf">review paper</a> by Roijers et al.

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Filter methods have not been applied to RL much, so there is a lot of uncertainty around the difficulty of the problem.</p>
