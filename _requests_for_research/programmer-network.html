<p>Train a neural network that is able to produce source code
which solves a task which is provided to the agent as an input e.g. 
 in text format.</p>

<p> This will require creation of a set of environments, 
where in every environment an agent is trained to produce a working source code which 
is a solution to a problem, description of which is given as input to the agent.  
Such environments should range from very simple environments where 
an agent needs to solve simple tasks like sorting or printing 
"Hello world" to e.g. obtaining the fastest solution to some original
problem (this is why RL is necessary).  </p>

<p> Data for such environments could be obtained from various programming 
competitions or from existing code online and its description. </p>

<p> A direct application of such agents would be to automatize routine
programming tasks and improve the quality of existing code. </p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>This problem is very hard and is rather far fetched. It is likely that
training an agent which is capable of actually programming would require
approach with a very efficient knowledge transfer; In particular, such agent
would need to be able to read and understand existing docs and source code.</p>
