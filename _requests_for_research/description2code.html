<p> The (extremely) ambitious goal of this request is to solve the problem
  of turning descriptions into code.  It is outside the reach of
  current machine learning algorithms.
  However, <a href="https://github.com/ethancaballero">ethancaballero</a>
  has
  collected <a href="https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0Bz3fihKG133ceWNFQTQ5S0xhZUk&export=download">5000
  input-output examples of programming challenges</a>.  It can be
  interesting to play with this small dataset, to see whether
  anything interesting can be achieved with an application of
  standard supervised learning techniques. </p>
